# CMPSC 100: Computational Expression Profile

Fill in the following questions to complete the profile. This activity 
practices skills related to Github and the Github Flavored Markdown (GFM) 
variant of Markdown, a language that many fields beyond computer science use 
to create documentation. This language allows readers with access to Markdown
systems  to view text just as well formatted as those _without_ such software.

In assignments for this course, you will be given source code documents and 
Markdown documents to complete. These documents will contain markers
that illustrate where work should occur. Follow these markers to complete the tasks.

## Profile

Fill out the following items. Some will require longer, paragraph-level 
answers. Where there is simply a `TODO`, replace the `TODO` with your full
answer. Where there is a set of brackets (`[]`), fill in the space with an `x` 
character (this should create a filled-in checkbox when uploaded  to Github).

For example, a correctly-filled in checkbox would look like this:

```
- [x] Correct
- [ x ] Incorrect
```

> [!Information]
> Protip: when filling in a field like `TODO` you can remove the "backticks" (`)
> surrounding the marker. That turns it back into regular text.

### Computer Facts

I am a(n):

- [ ] Apple user
- [x] Windows user
- [x] Unix user (Ubuntu/Debian, et al.)

- [ ] I would like a laptop loan through the department

On a scale of `1` (very inexperienced) to `5` (very experienced), how comfortable do you feel using a computer?

> For example, a student who is comfortable using programs like Photoshop,
> Word, Excel, and/or other programs that require a great deal of input 
> (excluding gaming) and has experience installing a wide variety of programs
> without a great deal of assistance might rank a `3` (or higher).

- [ ] 1
- [ ] 2
- [ ] 3
- [ ] 4
- [x] 5

- [x] I have already taken at least one computer science course
